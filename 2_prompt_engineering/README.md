# Task 2: Prompt engineering
In this part of task 2, we will go beyond transfer learning to explore prompt engineering.

## Important resources

# Approach
To "ask" a model to display a specific behaviour relevant to one of the cases below, you will try out different prompts to see what works and suggest why.

## NB
In this notebook, we'll be using a GPT-2 large model, which is not as good as the latest GPT-3 in terms of prompt engineering but small enough to load on a free Colab instance. To explore GPT-3, consider https://play.aidungeon.io, where it's possible not only to play the game itself but experiment with GPT-3 prompts. However, **it's not the same** GPT-3 as the one available via the [OpenAI API beta](https://beta.openai.com).
